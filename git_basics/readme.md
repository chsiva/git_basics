# git clone 
is how you "get a local copy" of an existing repository "to work on". 
It's usually "only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around".

# git pull (or git fetch + git merge) 
is how you "update that local copy with new commits" from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a command that you will run frequently.
