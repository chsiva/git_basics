# GitHub Actions: 
     CI/CD where you can build, test and deploy on specified Runners
     Automates workflows triggered by GitHub events (push, PR, schedule, etc.).
     Uses YAML files to define jobs and steps in workflows.

Workflows : A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
Jobs: A set of steps run sequentially on the same runner
Steps: Individual task within a job (e.g., run a script, checkout code).

# How do you trigger a GitHub Actions workflow?
  On GitHub events like push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch, schedule, release, etc.
  Can specify filters like branches, tags, or paths.
on:
push:
branches:
 - main
pull_request:
branches:
 - develop

# What runners are available in GitHub Actions?
  - GitHub-hosted runners: Provided by GitHub, pre-configured VM images (Linux, Windows, macOS).
  - Self-hosted runners: Your own machines/servers you configure to run workflows.


# How do you pass secrets and environment variables in GitHub Actions?
  On Repo settings > Actions secrets and variables
   - Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive data securely.
   - Access secrets in workflow via ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}.
   - Can also set environment variables at workflow, job, or step level.

# How can you reuse code or workflows in GitHub Actions?
  1. Reusable Workflow (.github/workflows/reusable.yml)
  2. Use workflow_call event to call reusable workflows
     name: Reusable Workflow  
       on:
         workflow_call:
     jobs:
       call-reusable:
          uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml




| Feature                   | Composite Actions (using: "composite")   | Reusable Workflows (`workflow_call`)     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                   | Reuse a sequence of steps in **one job** | Reuse **entire workflows or jobs**       |
| YAML Location             | `.github/actions/my-action/action.yml`   | `.github/workflows/reusable.yml`         |
| Called with               | `uses: ./github/actions/my-action`       | `uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml` |
| Can define multiple jobs? | ❌ No                                     | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Can access secrets?       | ✅ Yes                                    | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Can run scripts?          | ✅ Yes (with `run:`)                      | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Better for...             | Small, repeatable logic in one job       | Higher-level orchestration, full flows   |

composite example 
on: push
jobs:
  example_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/my-composite-action
        with:
          input_name: 'World'
        id: my_composite_step
      - name: Use output from composite action
        run: echo "Output from composite action: ${{ steps.my_composite_step.outputs.output_name }}"

# What is the difference between jobs.<job_id>.needs and jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix?
  - needs: Defines job dependencies; a job waits for others to finish.
  - strategy.matrix: Runs the same job with different configurations (e.g., different OS or language versions).

# How do you handle failure or retry in GitHub Actions?
  - Use continue-on-error to ignore step failures.
  - Use if conditionals to run steps/jobs conditionally.
  - Use jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes to limit execution time.
  Currently, no native retry, but you can script retries or use marketplace actions.

# How do you debug failed GitHub Actions runs?
    - Check logs on GitHub Actions UI.
    - Use ::debug:: commands in workflow scripts.
    - Run workflows locally using tools like act.
    - Add verbose logging in your scripts.

# How do you control access and permissions in GitHub Actions?
   - Use repository and organization level actions policies.
   - Control access to secrets and tokens.
   - Use least privilege principle in workflow permissions.

# Build artifacts In GitHub Actions, 
   artifacts are files or data generated during a workflow run that you can save and share between jobs or download later. They're commonly used to store:

    - Build outputs (e.g., compiled binaries, packages)
    - Test results
    - Log files
    - Coverage reports
