# Why GitHub upgrades - 
 To ensure you benefit from latest security patches, features, and bug fixes while minimizing  the potential disruption of larger version jumps.

# what actions when we upgarde GitLab servers
  Most helpful actions include : backup craetion > testing lower environment > following recommended upgrade Path > utilizing maintenance mode during the upgrade > carefully managing backups> rollback plan in case of any issues > essentially planning and controlled process to minimize downtime and potential disruptions to user

  Inform users via communication channel on GitHub channel  ( broadcast messages )
  enable maintainence mode > backup> Stop repilica mode > download package and upgrade ( ghe-upgrade)

# Github servers are cluster ( mutliple nodes - have moth primary and secondary) ?

# avoid merge conflicts

Each developer should clone repo, before any change to the branch, developer should perform pull operation > Any new changes should be fetched and

| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **`git clone`**  | Copies entire remote repo to your machine                                   | No                | Remote → Local | First time you're working with a repository         |
| **`git fetch`**  | Downloads latest changes from remote, but doesn’t merge                     | No                | Remote → Local | To preview or inspect remote updates                |
| **`git pull`**   | Fetches + merges remote branch into current local branch                    | Maybe (merge)     | Remote → Local | To bring in the latest code and automatically merge |
| **`git merge`**  | Combines two branches (adds a merge commit unless it's fast-forward)        | Yes (adds commit) | Local          | To integrate changes from another branch            |
| **`git rebase`** | Moves your branch's commits on top of another base (linear history)         | Yes (rewrites)    | Local          | To clean up history before merging                  |
| **`git squash`** | Combines multiple commits into one (via interactive rebase or squash merge) | Yes (rewrites)    | Local          | To clean "WIP" commits before pushing or merging    |

# git clone with ssh vs clone with https
with https no need any authentication
with ssh we need authenticate -> generate ssh keys in local -> copy rsa.pub -> paste it in github/settings/ssh-key

# Forking
A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

# git rebase

It's simple. With rebase you say to use another branch as the new base for your work.

If you have, for example, a branch master, you create a branch to implement a new feature, and say you name it cool-feature, of course the master branch is the base for your new feature.

Now at a certain point you want to add the new feature you implemented in the master branch. You could just switch to master and merge the cool-feature branch:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature
But this way a new dummy commit is added. If you want to avoid spaghetti-history you can rebase:

$ git checkout cool-feature
$ git rebase master
And then merge it in master:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature


# git squash
For example, assume that you have a series of n commits.
By squashing you can make all the n-commits to a single commit.

# Avoid "merge conflicts" https://dev.to/samuyi/how-to-avoid-merge-conflicts-3j8d
Solution:

*create a new branch* -> in local CLI create a repo and clone the repo here -> git checkout <new-branch> ->
download & install "Meld" (file comparision tool) https://meldmerge.org/. ->

*do merge locally* -> *create new PR*

# clone specific branch 
git clone -b <branch-name> <remote_repo_url>
