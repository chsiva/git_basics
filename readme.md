# Why GitHub upgrades - 
 To ensure you benefit from latest security patches, features, and bug fixes while minimizing  the potential disruption of larger version jumps.

# what actions when we upgarde GitLab servers
  Most helpful actions include : backup craetion > testing lower environment > following recommended upgrade Path > utilizing maintenance mode during the upgrade > carefully managing backups> rollback plan in case of any issues > essentially planning and controlled process to minimize downtime and potential disruptions to user

  Inform users via communication channel on GitHub channel  ( broadcast messages )
  enable maintainence mode > backup> Stop repilica mode > download package and upgrade ( ghe-upgrade)

# Github servers are cluster ( mutliple nodes - have moth primary and secondary) ?

You're right, both git pull and git rebase are used to update your local branch with changes from a remote repository. However, the way they achieve this differs and has implications for your commit history. 

Here's the key difference:
 git pull (by default):
   - Fetches and merges: git pull is a combination of two commands: git fetch and git merge.
   - Creates merge commits: By default, it fetches the latest changes from the remote and then merges them into your current branch. This process creates a new "merge commit" to            combine the histories of both branches.
   - Non-linear history: The merge commits result in a non-linear commit history, which shows how branches diverged and converged.
   - Preserves history: This approach preserves the complete history, including all merge commits. 
 git rebase (or git pull --rebase):
   - Rewrites history: git rebase moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
   - Applies changes on top: It takes your local commits and reapplies them on top of the latest commit from the target branch (e.g., the remote's main branch).
   - Linear history: This creates a linear history that makes it look like you started your work from the latest version of the target branch.
   - Avoids merge commits: It avoids creating extra merge commits, resulting in a cleaner and simpler commit history. 
 In summary:
  - git pull combines fetch and merge, creating merge commits and a potentially non-linear history.
  - git rebase (or git pull --rebase) rewrites history by applying your commits on top of the target branch, resulting in a linear history without merge commits. 
  - Choosing between git pull and git rebase:


# git clone with ssh vs clone with https
with https no need any authentication
with ssh we need authenticate -> generate ssh keys in local -> copy rsa.pub -> paste it in github/settings/ssh-key

# Forking
A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.



#Branch protection rules

  - File [ Place the CODEOWNERS file in the root, .github/, or docs/ folder.]
    You can use GitHub usernames (@username) or team handles (@org/team-name).
  - Manually [ Open settings on Repo > Branches > Add Branch Protection Rule ]
  

  Combine branch protection rules with CI/CD pipelines to ensure quality.

  Use code owners to automatically request reviews from specific teams.

  Review rules periodically to match team workflow changes.
# git rebase

It's simple. With rebase you say to use another branch as the new base for your work.

If you have, for example, a branch master, you create a branch to implement a new feature, and say you name it cool-feature, of course the master branch is the base for your new feature.

Now at a certain point you want to add the new feature you implemented in the master branch. You could just switch to master and merge the cool-feature branch:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature
But this way a new dummy commit is added. If you want to avoid spaghetti-history you can rebase:

$ git checkout cool-feature
$ git rebase master
And then merge it in master:

$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature


# git squash
For example, assume that you have a series of n commits.
By squashing you can make all the n-commits to a single commit.

# Avoid "merge conflicts" https://dev.to/samuyi/how-to-avoid-merge-conflicts-3j8d
* Solution: 
  - Each developer should clone repo
  - before merging they need to check for changes in remote brach > git pull to ensure for any changes by other developer
  - if there are any changes dev should merge
  - Test locally and then make a PR




*create a new branch* -> in local CLI create a repo and clone the repo here -> 
git checkout <new-branch> ->

download & install "Meld" (file comparision tool) https://meldmerge.org/. ->

*do merge locally* -> *create new PR*

# clone specific branch 
git clone -b <branch-name> <remote_repo_url>
