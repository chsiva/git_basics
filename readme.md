# git pull
git pull will changes that are done in remote/central repo

# git fetch

# git clone 
is how you "get a local copy" of an existing repository "to work on". 
It's usually "only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around".

# git pull (or git fetch + git merge) 
is how you "update that local copy with new commits" from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a command that you will run frequently.

# git clone with ssh vs clone with https
with https no need any authentication
with ssh we need authenticate -> generate ssh keys in local -> copy rsa.pub -> paste it in github/settings/ssh-key
